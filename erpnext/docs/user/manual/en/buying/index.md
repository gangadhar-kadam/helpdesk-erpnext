# Buying

If your business involves physical goods, buying is one of your core business
activity. Your suppliers are as important as your customers and they must be
provided with as much accurate information as possible.

Buying in right amounts, in right quantities, can affect your cash flow and
profitability.

ERPNext contains a set of transactions that will make your buying process as
efficient and seamless as possible.
