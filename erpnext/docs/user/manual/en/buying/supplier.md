Suppliers are companies or individuals who provide you with products or
services. They are treated in exactly the same manner as Customers in ERPNext.

You can create a new Supplier via:

> Buying > Documents > Supplier > New Supplier

### Contacts and Addresses

Contacts and Addresses in ERPNext are stored separately so that you can attach
multiple Contacts or Addresses to Customers and Suppliers. To add a Contact or
Address go to Buying and click on “New Contact” or “New Address”.

> Tip: When you select a Supplier in any transaction, one Contact and Address
gets pre-selected. This is the “Default Contact or Address”. So make sure you
set your defaults correctly!

### Integration with Accounts

In ERPNext, there is a separate Account record for each Supplier, of Each
company.

When you create a new Supplier, ERPNext will automatically create an Account
Ledger for the Supplier under “Accounts Payable” in the Company set in the
Supplier record.

> Advanced Tip: If you want to change the Account Group under which the
Supplier Account is created, you can set it in the Company master.

If you want to create an Account in another Company, just change the Company
value and “Save” the Supplier again.

> Tip: You can also import from the Data Import Tool
