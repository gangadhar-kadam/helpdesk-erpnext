<h1>Search Record by Specific Field</h1>

While creating any document in ERPNext, you might have to select other record id in it (like selecting Customer in Quotation). For ease in selecting other record, you can search them based on value in various fields of that record. Search By functionality enables you searching and filtering records based on value in the specific fields of that record.

Let's consider an example to learn Search By functionality better. While creating Sales Order, we need to select Customer in it. If we need to filter search result of Customer for specific Customer Group, we should go about following these steps to achieve it.

####Search By in Customize Form

In the Customize Form tool, you will find field called Search Field. You should enter field names based on which we can search and filter result for this document.

Considering our scenario, we should update name of Customer Group field for Customer in the Customize Form.
