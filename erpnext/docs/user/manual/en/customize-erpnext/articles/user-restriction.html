<h1>Owner Restriction</h1>

To restricting user based on Owner (creator of record),&nbsp; form/document should have field linked with User master. If that document is not linked with user, then you should create <a href="https://erpnext.com/user-guide/customize-erpnext/custom-field" target="_blank">custom field</a> and link it with User master.
<br>
<br>Following are the steps to restrict User based on Owner.
<br>
<br><b>Step 1: </b>Go to:
<br>
<br>Setup &gt; Permissions &gt; Role Permissions Manager
<br>
<br><b>Step 2:</b> Select Document Type for which you want to set user permission. After permissions are loaded for selected document, scroll to role for which you want to set restriction.

<br><b>Step 3:</b> For Role to be resricted (Sales User in this case), check "Apply User Restriction". On checking Apply User Permission, two links will be show up called:
<br>
<br>- Select Document Type
<br>- Select User Permissions
<br>
<br>Click on "Select Document Type".

<br>
<br><b>Step 4:</b> Check mark on User, and un-check for others. If you want user to be restricted based on some other criteria as well, like territory, customer groups, then that should be checked as well.
