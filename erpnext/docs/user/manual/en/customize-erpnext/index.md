# Customize ERPNext

ERPNext offers many tools to customize the system.

You simplify the forms by hiding features you donâ€™t need using Disable
Features and Module Setup, add Custom Fields, change form properties, like
adding more options to drop-downs or hiding fields using Customize Form View
and make your own Print Formats by using HTML Templates. You can also create
multiple Letter Heads for your Prints.
