In ERPNext, you can manage Employee Appraisals by creating an Appraisal
Template for each role with the parameters that define the performance by
giving appropriate weightage to each parameter.

> Human Resource > Appraisal > New

#### Step 1: Select an Appraisal Template

<img class="screenshot" alt="Appraisal" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/human-resources/appraisal.png">

After you select the template, the remaining form appears.

#### Step 2: Enter Employee Details

<img class="screenshot" alt="Appraisal" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/human-resources/appraisal-employee.png">

Once the Appraisal Template is completed, you can create Appraisal records for
each period where you track performance. You can give points out of 5 for each
parameter and the system will calculate the overall performance of the
Employee.

To make the Appraisal final, make sure to “Submit” it.
