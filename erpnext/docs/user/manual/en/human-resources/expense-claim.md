Expense Claim is made when Employee’s make expenses out of their pocket on
behalf of the company. For example, if they take a customer out for lunch,
they can make a request for reimbursement via the Expense Claim form.

To make a new Expense Claim, go to:

> HR > Expense Claim > New Expense Claim

Set the Employee ID, date and the list of expenses that are to be claimed and
“Submit” the record.

### Approving Expenses

The person making the claim must also set the id of the user who will
“Approve” these expenses and set the “Assign To” to notify the user of the
request Approve.

If the Approver sees the “form”, she or he can update the “Approved Amounts”
and click on “Approve”. To cancel the claim, they can click on the “Reject”
button.

Comments can be added in the Comments section explaining why the claim was
approved or rejected.

### Booking the Expense and Reimbursement

The approved Expense Claim must then be converted into a Journal Entry and a
payment must be made. Note: This amount should not be clubbed with Salary
because the amount will then be taxable to the Employee.
