Holiday List is a list which contains the dates of holidays along with the
occasion of that holiday. The list is generally valid for one calendar year.  

Most organisations have a standard Holiday-List for their employees. Some even
have different holiday lists for laborers and a different one for management
staff.

  

To set up a holiday list in the system, Go to Human Resources Module and Click
on Holiday List.

> Note 1: If you have selected a holiday list in the Employment Details form,
the system will give priority to the form mentioned here. It will fetch the
list mentioned in the form rather than the one which you may have specified as
Default; However, if there is no list in the employment details form, the
default list will be fetched.


> Note 2: You can form as many holiday lists as you wish. For example, if you
have a mill, you can have one list for mill workers and another list for
office staff. You can manage between lists by attaching their respective
holiday list to their respective employment detail form.
