## What is an ERP and why should I care?

(If you are already convinced you need an all-in-one system for your
organization, you can skip this page.)

If you are running a small business that has a few employees, you understand
that it's hard to manage the dynamic nature of doing businesses. You are
already using a software like Accounting, and may be some more to manage your
inventory and sales (or CRM).

An ERP brings all of this together in one place.

Small businesses are not so different from large ones. They contain most of
the complexities of a large business along with many other constraints. Small
businesses have to communicate with customers, do accounts, pay taxes, do
payroll, manage timelines, deliver quality, answer questions, and keep
everyone happy just like in large businesses.

Large businesses have the advantage of using advanced data systems to manage
their process efficiently. Small businesses, on the other hand, typically
struggle to keep things organized. They often use a mix of apps like
spreadsheets, accounting software, web CRM etc to manage.The problem is, not
everyone is on the same page. An ERP changes that.
