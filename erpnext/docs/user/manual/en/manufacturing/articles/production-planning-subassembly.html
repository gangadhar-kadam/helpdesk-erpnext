<h1>Production Planning & Subassembly</h1>

if you need Production Planning Tool to consider raw-materials required for the manufacturing of sub-assembly items selected in the BOM, please check following instructions to achieve the same.<br><br>Production Planning Tool has field called "Use Multi-Level BOM", checking which will consider raw-material of sub-assemblies as well in the material planning. If this field is not checked, then it will consider sub-assembly as an item, and won't consider raw-material required for the manufacturing of that sub-assembly.<br><br><img src="{{docs_base_path}}/assets/img/articles/$SGrab_203.png"><br><br>You will find same field in the Production Order and Stock Entry as well.<br><br>This feature is very useful for the companies who create BOM for the
 sub-assemblies, but Production Order is created only for the finished 
item. They do not create separate Production Order for the 
sub-assemblies, but raw-materials as listed in the BOM of sub-assembly 
items are consumed in the production process, and not sub-assembly item 
directly.<br>
