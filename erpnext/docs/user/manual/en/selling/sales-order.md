# Sales Order

The Sales Order confirms your sales and triggers purchase (**Material
Request**) shipment (**Delivery Note**), billing (**Sales Invoice**) and
manufacturing (**Production Plan**)

A Sales Order is usually a binding Contract with your Customer.

Once your customer confirms the Quotation you can convert your Quotation into
a Sales Order.

Most of the information in your Sales Order is the same as the Quotation.
There are a few amongst other things that a Sales Order will ask you to
update.

  * Expected date of delivery.
  * Customer Purchase Order number: If your customer has sent you a Purchase Order, you can update its number for future reference (in billing).

### Packing List

The “Packing List” table will be automatically updated when you “Save” the
Sales Order. If any Items in your table are Product Bundle (packets), then the
“Packing List” will contain the exploded (detailed) list of your Items.

### Reservation and Warehouses

If your Sales Order contains Items for which inventory is tracked (Is Stock
Item is “Yes”) then, ERPNext will ask you for “Reservation Warehouse”. If you
have set a default Warehouse for the Item, it will automatically set this
Warehouse here.

This “reserved” quantity will help you project what is the quantity you need
to purchase based on all your commitments.

### Sales Team

**Sales Partner:** If this Sale was booked via a Sales Partner, you can update the Sales Partner’s details with commission and other info that you can aggregate.

**Sales Persons:** ERPNext allows you to tag multiple Sales Persons who may have worked on this deal. You can also split the amount in targets of different Sales Persons and track how much incentives they earned on this deal.

### Recurring Sales Orders

If you have a recurring contract with a Customer where you are required to generate a Sales Order on a monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual basis, you can check the “Convert To Recurring Order” box. 

Here you can fill in the details like; of how frequently you want to generate an Order in the 'Recurring Type' field, specify the day of of the month on which the Order needs to be generated in the 'Repeat On Day Of Month' field and the date on which the recurring orders should stop in the 'End Date' field.

**Recurring Type:** Here you can update how frequently you want to generate an Order.

**Repeat On Day Of Month:** You can specify the day of of the month on which the Order needs to be generated.

**End Date:** The date on which the recurring orders should stop can be specified here.

On updating the Sales Order, a Recurring ID will be generated which will be same for all recurring orders generated from this particular Sales Order.

ERPNext will automatically create new Order and mail a notification to the email IDs you set in the 'Notification Email Address'field.
