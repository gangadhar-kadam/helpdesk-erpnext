# Setting Up

Setting up an ERP system is like starting your business all over again,
although in the virtual world. Thankfully it is not as hard as the real
business and you get to do a trial too!

Implementation requires the implementer to take a step back and set aside some
time to do this right. This is usually not a couple-of-hours, after-work kind
of a project.
