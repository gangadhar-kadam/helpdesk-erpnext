# Letter Heads

You can manage multiple letter heads in ERPNext. In a letter head you can:

  * Create an image with your logo, brand and other information that you want to put on your letter head.
  * Attach the image in your Letter Head record by clicking on image icon to automatically generate the HTML required for this Letter Head.
  * If you want to make this the default letter head, click on “Is Default”.

Your letter head will now appear in all Prints and Emails of documents.

You can create / manage Letter Heads from:

> Setup > Printing > Letter Head > New Letter Head
