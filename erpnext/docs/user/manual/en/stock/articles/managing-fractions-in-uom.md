<h1>Managing Fractions in UoM</h1>

UoM stands for Unit of Measurement. Few examples of UoM are Numbers (Nos), Kgs, Litre, Meter, Box, Carton etc.

There are few UoMs which cannot have value decimal places. For example, if we have television for an item, with Nos as its UoM, we cannot have 1.5 Nos. of television, or 3.7 Nos. of computer sets. The value of quantity for these items must be whole number.

You can configure if particular UoM can have value in decimal place or no. Bydefault, decimal places will be allowed in all the UoMs. To restrict decimal places or value in fraction for any UoM, you should follow these steps.
