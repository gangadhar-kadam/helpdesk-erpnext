A warehouse is a commercial building for storage of goods. Warehouses are used
by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses,
customs, etc. They are usually large plain buildings in industrial areas of
cities, towns, and villages. They mostly have loading docks to load and unload
goods from trucks.

To go to Warehouse, click on Stock and go to Warehouse under Masters.  You
could also go to the Setup module and click on Warehouse under Master Data.

> Stock > Warehouse > New Warehouse

In ERPNext, every Warehouse must belong to a specific company, to maintain
company wise stock balance. The Warehouses are saved with their respective
companyâ€™s abbreviations. This facilitates in identifying which Warehouse
belongs to which company, at a glance.

You can include user restrictions for these Warehouses. In case you do not
wish a particular user to operate on a particular Warehouse, you can refrain
the user from accessing that Warehouse.

### Merge Warehouse

In day to day transactions, duplicate entries are done by mistake, resulting
in duplicate Warehouses. Duplicate records can be merged into a single
Warehouse. From the top bar of the system select the File menu. Select Rename
and Enter the correct Warehouse and check the Merge button. The system will
replace all the links of wrong Warehouse with the correct Warehouse, in all
transactions. Also, the available quantity (actual qty, reserved qty, ordered
qty etc) of all items in the duplicate warehouse will be transferred to the
correct warehouse. Once merging is done, delete the duplicate Warehouse.

> Note: ERPNext system maintains stock balance for every distinct combination
of Item and Warehouse. Thus you can get stock balance for any specific Item in
a particular Warehouse on any particular date.
