All machines require regular maintenance, specially those that contain a lot
of moving parts, so if you are in the business of maintaining those or have
some of them in your own premises, this is a useful tool to plan a calendar of
activities for its maintenance.

If the Customer Issue refers to “Breakdown Maintenance”, this refers to
“Preventive Maintenance”.

To create a new Maintenance Schedule go to:

> Support > Maintenance Schedule > New Maintenance Schedule

<img class="screenshot" alt="Maintenance Schedule" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/support/maintenance-schedule.png">

In the Maintenance Schedule, there are two sections:

In the first section, you select the Items for which you want to generate the
schedule and set how frequently you want to plan a visit or a maintenance.
These can be optionally fetched from a Sales Order. After selecting the Items,
“Save” the record.

The second section contains the maintenance activities planned in the
schedule. “Generate Schedule” will generate a separate row for each
maintenance activity.

Each Item in a Maintenance Schedule is allocated to a Sales Person.

When the document is “Submitted” Calendar events are created in the User of
the Sales Person for each maintenance.
