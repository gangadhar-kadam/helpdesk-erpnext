We live in an era when people are very comfortable communicating, discussing,
asking, assigning work and getting feedback electronically. The Internet acts
as a great medium to collaborate on work too. Taking this concept into ERP
system, we have designed a bunch of tools whereby you can Assign transactions,
manage your To Dos, share and maintain a Calendar, maintain a company wise
Knowledge Base, Tag and Comment on transactions and send your Orders, Invoices
etc via Email. You can also send instant messages to other users using the
Messaging tool.

These tools are integrated into all aspects of the product so that you can
effectively manage your data and collaborate with your co-workers.
