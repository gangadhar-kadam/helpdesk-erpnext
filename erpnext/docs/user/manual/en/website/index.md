Websites are a core component of any business and having a good website
usually means:

  * Invest lot of money.
  * Difficult to update.
  * Not interactive.

Unless you are a web designer yourself.

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a way to update your product catalog on your
site automatically from your ERP?

We thought exactly the same and hence built a small Website Development app
right inside ERPNext! Using ERPNextâ€™s Website module, you can

  1. Create Web Pages
  2. Write a Blog
  3. Publish your Product Catalog using the Item master

We will soon be adding a shopping cart facility so that your customers can
place orders and pay you online!

Though not necessary, to make a good website, you might have to know a bit of
HTML / CSS or hire the services of a professional. The good part is that once
this is setup, you can add and edit content, blogs and products directly from
your ERP.
